[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00844)]

In this repository, we present **GAN2Shape**, which reconstructs the 3D shape of an image using off-the-shelf 2D image GANs in an unsupervised manner.
Our method **does not rely on mannual annotations or external 3D models**, yet it achieves high-quality 3D reconstruction, object rotation, and relighting effects.

The source code is expected to be released at Jan. 2021.
