In this repository, we present **GAN2Shape**, which reconstructs the 3D shape of an image using off-the-shelf 2D image GANs in an unsupervised manner.
Our method **does not rely on mannual annotations or external 3D models**, yet it achieves high-quality 3D reconstruction, object rotation, and relighting effects.

Due to some conflicts in my personal schedule, the expected code release date is postponed to 21, Feb. Sorry about this and thanks for your patience.
